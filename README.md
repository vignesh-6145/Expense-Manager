  ### Background
  This was project was part of learning journey of JAVA. I started developing this project as a learning project (learning by building). This may lack many best practises but I tried my level best
  to understand every concept I learned without directly copy and pasting. Please feel free to provide your feedback.
  
  Thanks and Regards

<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Secure Authentication and Authorization
*   OpenAPI Integration
*   Split the Bill with your friends(planned)
*   Summary Dashoard(on it)
<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps:</h2>
As the Docker support was added to the project one can simple construct the image and run the container.Will be further by pushing the image to the docker registry

### Steps to build the image 

- run the command ./mvnw install
- build the image
 ex :- `docker build -t exp-mngr-app .`
  - name of the image **exp-mngr-app** 
- run the container by mapping the container port 8081 (since specified in applicatoin.properties) to any local port
 ex :- `docker run -p 8082:8081 exp-mngr-app`
  - local port : 8082
  - container port : 8081
 - now you can use the API's with tools such as postman/talend platforms
